**Pitch:** #1 - Tool Specification Template  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Date Started:** 2026-02-18

## Goal
Create clear specification templates for every tool used by Sol AI assistant. Reduces errors from vague descriptions.

## Linked Research
- Paper #4: MCP Tool Descriptions Are Smelly

## Progress

### 2026-02-18
- [ ] Create specification template structure
- [ ] Audit current tools in TOOLS.md
- [ ] Document each tool with template
- [ ] Test and refine

---

## Why This Matters

Research shows MCP tool descriptions are often inadequate. Vague descriptions lead to:
- Wrong tool selection
- Wasted tokens on failed attempts
- Lost trust in tool-selection ability

A clear specification ensures every tool has: purpose, inputs, outputs, examples, and pitfalls documented.

## Approach

1. Create reusable template
2. Audit existing tools
3. Document each tool consistently
4. Store in TOOLS.md for easy reference
